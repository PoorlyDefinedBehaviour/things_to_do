# Long term objective

I'm mostly interested in working at high quality companies where quality is defined as the people i work with + compensation + the problem to solve + environment + recognition.

I like this definition of a software engineer by [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/):

> Why learn computer science?
>
> There are 2 types of software engineer: those who understand computer science well enough to do challenging, innovative work, and those who just get by because they’re familiar with a few high level tools.
> 
> Both call themselves software engineers, and both tend to earn similar salaries in their early careers. But Type 1 engineers progress toward more fulfilling and well-remunerated work over time, whether that’s valuable commercial work or breakthrough open-source projects, technical leadership or high-quality individual contributions.
> 
> Type 1 engineers find ways to learn computer science in depth, whether through conventional means or by relentlessly learning throughout their careers. Type 2 engineers typically stay at the surface, learning specific tools and technologies rather than their underlying foundations, only picking up new skills when the winds of technical fashion change.

# Things i want to learn or get better at

## Long term

- Learn more about networking (maybe implement a few protocols)
- Set theory
- Operating systems
- Distributed systems
- Computer science in general
- Compilers

## Near future

- AWS solutions
- Kong api gateway
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Kafka

## Topics that i may visit/revisit if i have the time

- State machines
- Type theory

### Return on investment when it comes to learning

- Papers and documentation for introductions
- Source code, books and papers for deep dives
- Hands on for developing an intuition
- Blog posts are generally low quality but you can find a few good ones once in a while
